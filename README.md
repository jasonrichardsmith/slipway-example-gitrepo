# Slipway Example GitRepo

This repository holds many examples on how to use Slipway.

Please feel free to clone or, if you are comfortable with using kubectl
apply with remote resources you can do that as well.
This article assumes you are running your own local clone.

You will need a Kubernetes cluster with [Slipway controller running
on the cluster](https://github.com/slipway-gitops/slipway/blob/master/DEPLOY.md).
